# The Tea Party

This was a site that I made for a school project in English class.  I just want the presentation to look nice.
I actually got in trouble because I used asynchronous code that ended up making the posts submit at a time that the teacher
said they weren't willing to accept.  I talked it over though and saved my grade. BlogURL
